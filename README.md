# Signup-Form Project

A simple sign-up form built with HTML and CSS. This project simulates an online registration form that takes user input for account creation.

## Demo

You can view the Signup form by opening the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the form structure.
- `assets/css/styles.css`: The stylesheet for styling the form and its components.
- `assets/img/background-image.jpg`: The background image for the form's sidebar.

## Features

- **User Inputs**: The form collects basic information including:
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Email Address
    - Phone Number
    - Password
    - Confirm Password
- **Responsive Design**: The form is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Form Validation**: All fields are required, and the form ensures that users cannot submit without filling in all fields.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Complete the fields in the form:
   - Enter your first and last name.
   - Provide your email and phone number.
   - Set a password and confirm it.
3. Click **Create Account** to simulate account creation (note that this is a static form with no backend).
4. Alternatively, if you already have an account, you can click the **Log in** link.
